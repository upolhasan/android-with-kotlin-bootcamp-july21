4. Generate a signing configuration to automatically sign `release` builds
   - https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-auto
5. Remove signing information from your build files
   - https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#secure-shared-keystore
6. Uniquely configure `versionName` and `versionCode` based on build type
   - use Android Gradle Plugins `onVariants()` apis
